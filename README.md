Hi, This is my first Repository to Github Community.

Copy the File from the SourceCode and paste in the notepad
Save it in the format of .bat
Once you done with Saving file,Open CMD and point to file location
Ran the file
You will get the Output

Initially I had issue with output format,Later I came to know that it is due to non-ASCII format
